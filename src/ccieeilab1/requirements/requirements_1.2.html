   <p1>Complete and correct the EtherChannel configuration between switches sw101, sw102, sw110 according to these requirements: </p1><br>
   <br>
<p>At the end of the task, all EtherChannels between switches sw101, sw102, sw110 must be up and operational including all their physical member links.
  </p>
<p>Do not create new Port-channel interfaces; reuse those that already exist on the switches.  </p>
<p>When resolving existing issues, do not change the preconfigured negotiation protocol (if any).  </p>
<p>On EtherChannels that use a negotiation protocol, tune its mode of operation for the shortest link bundling time possible.

  Configure Spanning Tree protocol on switches sw101, sw102, sw110 according to these requirements:<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>The STP root for VLAN 2000 must be sw101.  </p>
<p>The STP root for VLAN 2001 must be sw102. </p>
<p>STP root muse be elected based on bridge priorities.  </p>
<p>On the three switches, have STP perform cost calculations in 32-bit arithmetic.  </p>
<p>On the three switches, use the Rapid STP version and ensure that it can achieve rapid convergence on all interconnections between the switches.  </p>
<p>On sw110, prevent all current and future access mode interfaces from being affected by the Proposal/Agreement process. </p><br>
