Complete and correct the OSPF configuration on the switches sw101, sw102, sw201 and sw202 according to these requirements:<br>
	<br>

	<p>Enable OSPFv2 on the redundant interconnections between the DC and HQ sites. Make sure that OSPF establishes adjacencies on these interconnections and exchanges routing information between the DC and HQ sites.</p>
	<p>Protect the authenticity and integrity of the OSPFv2 sessions on the redundant interconnections between DC and HQ with the SHA-384 mechanism. Use key ID 1 and a shared secret of “cci3” (without quotes).</p>
	<p>Improve the detection of unreachable OSPFv2 neighbors on the redundant interconnections between DC and HQ so that OSPF can detect the loss of a neighbor within 300 msec, with the probes being sent every 100 msec. It is not allowed to modify OSPF timers to accomplish this requirement.</p>
