	<p><strong><h1>2.4	Configuring SD-WAN VPN Route Leaking</h1></strong>
		
			
 <div style="border-bottom:2px solid #989898"></div>  <br>
<p1>To allow the traditional parts of the FABD2 network to communicate with the Employees and IoT VPNs/VNs, configure route leaking in SD-WAN according to these requirements:</p1><br>

	<p>Prefixes in the IoT VPN 198 must be imported into the existing SDA Underlay VPN 999 and tagged with the tag value of 198</p>
	<p>Prefixes in the Employees VPN 200 must be imported into the existing SDA Underlay VPN 999 and tagged with the tag value of 200</p>
	<p>Prefixes in the SDA Underlay VPN 999 advertised from the DC that are within the 10.4.0.0/15 range must be rejected. Other prefixes in the SDA Underlay VPN 999 advertised from the DC must be accepted and also imported into IoT VPN 198 and Employees VPN 200.</p>
	<p>Redistribution from OMP into OSPF on Branches #1 and #2 in VPN 999 must exclude vRoutes tagged with values 198 or 200.</p>
	<p>Place host41 into Employees VN. Place host51 into IoT VN. Make sure both hosts receive their IP settings from DHCP.</p>
	<p>Ensure that the IoT and Employees VPNs on Branches #1 and #2 have reachability to Branches #3 and #4. It is allowed to modify the VPN 999 OMP settings to accomplish this requirement.</p>
